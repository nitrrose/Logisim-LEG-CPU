# Logisim-LEG-CPU

This is my implementation of the LEG architecture from the game Turing Complete.

You will find a Logisim Evolution file containing the processor and a .pdf file containing opcodes and details on running the processor, as well as a link to a python replit program for converting LEG assembly into machine code.
There are numerous example programs also within this repository for use within the processor.

I started work on the processor on 13/01/24, and finished on 14/01/24

Thanks for checking out my project!
